Update is Stoke on Trentâ€™s Innovative Talking Newspaper and entertainment magazine.

We are comprised totally of a team of over 16 dedicated volunteers who serve the blind and partially sighted people in the local area by creating funded content, fundraising and grants.

One of the funded content we create is a series of audio recordings which range from the local news, Sports updates, weather and Royal National Institute of Blind People information among others.

Copies of the recordings were originally produced and distributed on MP3 audio players for the visually impaired, but with funding from the National Lottery we now have the capacity to host a website and bring our magazine into the online age
